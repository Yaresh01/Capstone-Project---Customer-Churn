# Capstone-Project---Customer-Churn

Problem statement & Business Objective:
The E-commerce company is facing tough competition and finding it challenging to keep its
current customers. They want to create a special system to predict when a customer might stop
using their services (churn prediction) and offer attractive deals to those customers to
encourage them to stay. It's important to note that when one account leaves, multiple customers
might be lost. The goal is to create a churn prediction model that can accurately identify
accounts that are likely to stop using their services.
Once the model predicts potential churners, the company will design unique and targeted offers
to keep those customers from leaving. However, they need to be careful not to offer too many
free or heavily discounted deals that could lead to financial losses for the company.
The business report should explain how the churn prediction model works and how well it
performs. Additionally, it should provide creative and effective campaign recommendations that
will entice customers to stay without causing financial problems for the company. The
recommendations should be based on the specific needs and preferences of potential churners,
aiming for higher customer retention and overall profitability.
